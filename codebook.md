Data Source

This dataset is derived from the 
"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which was
made available here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Attribute information

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Variables description

In this dataset, signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'X,Y and Z' denotes 3 direction in the X, Y and Z directions as follows

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
